# Monthly Active Users & Churn

Purpose of this project is to look at user data and build active and churn metrics to analyize their relationship versus eachother.

## Getting Started

To view the results for this analysis please log into the Redshift analytical DB.  Under schma rsarkis.active_churn you will find the results
for the analysis.  In the active_churn.SQL file you will find the query used to run this analysis to get the active and churn daily metrics.
Below is a screenshot of the dashboard created through redash in order to view the trend for the two metrics with a link to the live dashboard,
which is set to refresh every 24 hours in order to capture new data being populated.
